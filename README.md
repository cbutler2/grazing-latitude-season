Data and code in support of the manuscript.

Citation: Butler C., Wang Y., Verges A., Brown CJ., Ling S., Hurd CL., Bennett S.. Contrasting patterns in kelp consumption across latitude by two barren forming sea urchin species.

Overview of files: latitudinal_grazing.csv = individual grazing rates and size and weight metrics of two urchin species, collected from 5 sites across the southeast coast of Australia. These data were obtained over a 7 week period using in-situ grazing assays carried out over 3-5 days at each location.

seasonal_grazing.csv = individual grazing rates and size and weight metrics of two urchin species, collected every 4-6 weeks over a 19-month period at a single location in southeast Tasmania, Australia. These data were obtained using in-situ grazing assays carried out over 3-7 days for each time point.

latitudinal_cn.csv = carbon and nitrogen content of macroalgae used in the latitudinal grazing assays above.

seasonal_cn.csv = carbon and nitrogen content of macroalgae used in the seasonal grazing assays above.

latitudinal_temp_logger = in-situ temperatures recorded during latitudinal assay deployments.

seasonal_temp_logger = in-situ temperatures recorded during seasonal assay deployments.

grazing_analysis_latitudinal.R & grazing_analysis_seasonal.R = statistical R code used in the analysis presented.
